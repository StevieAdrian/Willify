                    <br> No, no, no, no <br> <br>
                    I still see your shadows in my room <br>
                    Can't take back the love that I gave you <br>
                    It's to the point where I love and I hate you <br>
                    And I cannot change you, so I must replace you (oh) <br>
                    Easier said than done <br>
                    I thought you were the one <br>
                    Listening to my heart instead of my head <br>
                    You found another one, but <br>
                    I am the better one <br>
                    I won't let you forget me <br>
                    I still see your shadows in my room <br>
                    Can't take back the love that I gave you <br>

                    And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh) <br>
                    Easier said than done <br>
                    I thought you were the one <br>
                    Listening to my heart instead of my head <br>
                    You found another one, but <br>
                    I am the better one <br>
                    I won't let you forget me <br> <br>
                    You left me falling and landing inside my grave <br>
                    I know that you want me dead <br>
                    I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay <br>
                    I know it's all in my head <br> <br>
                    I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing <br>
                    Thinking of you in my bed <br>
                    You were my everything <br>
                    Thoughts of a wedding ring <br>
                    Now I'm just better off dead <br>
                    I'll do it over again <br> 
                    I didn't want it to end <br>
                    I watched it blow in the wind <br>
                    I should've listened to my friends <br>
                    Leave this shit in the past <br>
                    But I want it to last <br>
                    You were made outta plastic (fake) <br>
                    I was tangled up in your drastic ways <br>
                    Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face? <br>
                    You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes <br>
                    I gave you my heart and you made heart break <br> <br>
                    You made my heart break
                    You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
                    You made my heart break
                    You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)
